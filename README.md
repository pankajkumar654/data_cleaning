# data_cleaning

## Overview
This repository contains scripts and SQL queries used for cleaning and preparing data from the "data_cleaning.nh" table. The data cleaning process involved various tasks such as date formatting, populating missing values, splitting address fields, standardizing values, removing duplicates, and deleting unused columns.

## Tasks Completed
**1) Date Formatting**: Convert date strings to the date data type.

**2) Populating Missing Values**: Update missing property addresses based on matching parcel IDs.

**3) Splitting Address Fields**: Separate property and owner addresses into individual columns (address, city, state).

**4) Standardizing Values**: Change 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' in the "SoldAsVacant" field.

**5) Removing Duplicates**: Delete duplicate records based on specific columns.

**6) Deleting Unused Columns**: Remove columns that are no longer needed after cleaning.
