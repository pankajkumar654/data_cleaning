## Overview
This repository contains scripts and SQL queries used for cleaning and preparing data from the "data_cleaning.nh" table.

## Tasks Completed
Date Formatting : Convert date strings to the date data type.
Populating Missing Values: Update missing property addresses based on matching parcel IDs.
Splitting Address Fields: Separate property and owner addresses into individual columns (address, city, state).
Standardizing Values: Change 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' in the "SoldAsVacant" field.
Removing Duplicates: Delete duplicate records based on specific columns.
Deleting Unused Columns: Remove columns that are no longer needed after cleaning.
